# Given the following code...

x = "hi there"
my_hash = {x: "some value"}
my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}
# What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?

# The first hash is created using the newer syntax, using symbols. 
# The sedond hash is using the older syntax, using => (implicit form).
